# Startup School 2.0
    
Welcome to the Startup School 2.0
This course is based on legendary [startup school](https://startupschool.com/) made by [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).

It is an experiment created to see if open source approach makes sense in education and if community contribiuts can make original content even better.

The idea is super simple - we start from the original course with original content made by YC, then we add some notes and exercises to hopefully make it more engaging and understandable.

## Woz 

Our objective is to archive greater understaning and utility of the material. In original YC course you train your organic neural network mainly by inputing data. 

We know that training neural networks is more efficent when model is also juged by the output. That's what we want to achive here. We want you to explain those ideas and brainstorm them with our AI tutor called Woz.
