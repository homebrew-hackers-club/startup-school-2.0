# 🧭 Module 1 — Why Startups?

Learn the *why* behind starting a startup.  
Before writing code or raising money, every founder has to decide —  
**should I actually start a startup?**  

This module explores that decision through the lens of Y Combinator’s founders,  
with insights from Paul Graham, Harj Taggar, and other YC partners.  
You’ll unpack the real motivations, tradeoffs, and psychological demands  
behind the decision to build something from scratch.



## 💡 What You’ll Learn

- The **core motivations** that drive successful founders (and the ones that don’t).  
- Why **resilience** is more valuable than confidence or credentials.  
- How to recognize when it’s **the right time to start** — or when to wait.  
- How to turn curiosity and side projects into conviction.  
- The **risks and rewards** of leaving big tech jobs (FAANG vs. startup).  
- The mindset shift from *employee* → *builder* → *founder.*


## 🧠 Key Ideas

- There’s **no single archetype** for founders — great ones look very different.  
- Early motivation doesn’t need to be perfect; it evolves through doing.  
- Startups are **learning accelerators** — even failure compounds experience.  
- “Comfort kills ambition.” Leaving stability is hard, but staying too long costs more.


## 🎯 Outcome

By the end of this module, you’ll have a clearer sense of:  
- Whether you’re ready (mentally and practically) to start something.  
- What you’d be giving up — and what you stand to gain.  
- How to build a path that prepares you for startup life, even if not today.
