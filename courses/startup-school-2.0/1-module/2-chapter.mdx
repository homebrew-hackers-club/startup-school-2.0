# Why You Should Leave Your FAANG Job

## 🧭 Overview

FAANG jobs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) can be lucrative and stable — but they can also **trap talented builders** in golden handcuffs.  
This talk breaks down when and why to leave, what you actually learn there, and how to make the transition toward startup life intentionally.


## 💼 When You Should Quit

- Stay long enough to extract skills, not so long that you get comfortable.  
- Leave **when your side projects excite you more than your day job.**
- If your company’s mission or product doesn’t energize you, that’s a signal.


## 🧠 What You Actually Learn at FAANG

- You get to **see scale, structure, and operational discipline** up close.  
- You learn how massive systems are maintained, and how teams collaborate.  
- But you **don’t learn how to start something from zero** — that’s startup-only experience.


## 💡 The Reality vs. Assumptions

**Assumption:** FAANG experience prepares you perfectly for startups.  
**Reality:** Most work there is optimizing small parts of giant systems.  
- You rarely make full-stack product decisions.  
- Risk and ownership are minimal.  
- It’s safe, but not entrepreneurial.


## 🔁 Transferable Skills

- **Technical excellence, debugging at scale, documentation, process discipline.**  
- **Communication in large teams** — useful for leading in startups later.  
- Just don’t confuse **skill specialization** with **founder readiness.**


## 💰 Path to Getting Funded

- FAANG pedigree helps you **get credibility with investors.**  
- Many YC-backed founders started in big tech, but **had something to prove.**
- Use that brand to open doors — not to hide behind it.


## 🧲 The Retention Trap

- Big companies **engineer comfort:** comp packages, promotions, RSUs, perks.  
- They want you to **optimize for staying**, not building.  
- Every vesting cycle is designed to reset your timeline and delay your escape.  
- The longer you stay, the harder it feels to leave.


## 🚪 When to Get Out

- When your job feels predictable but your side projects feel alive.  
- When learning plateaus — you’re just repeating cycles.  
- When “security” becomes your excuse, not your strategy.  
- Before your creativity calcifies into compliance.


## 🧩 Optimize Your FAANG Experience

- Go in **with a plan to leave.**  
- Focus on extracting:
  - Technical depth you can’t get elsewhere.  
  - Network of top engineers.  
  - Money to fund your runway.  
- Avoid being **a lifer.** Use FAANG, don’t let FAANG use you.


## 🧾 Key Takeaways

1. FAANG jobs teach scale, not creation.  
2. Extract skills and cash — then escape before you plateau.  
3. Use the brand, don’t build your identity around it.  
4. Plan your exit early — ideally within 2–4 years.  
5. The best time to leave is when you’re **more excited to build your own thing** than to optimize someone else’s.
