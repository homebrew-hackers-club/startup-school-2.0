## 🧭 Overview

You need to ask yourself 2 questions to know if you **“Should you start a startup?”** 

1. Are you the kind of person who should be a founder?  
2. If not now, how do you prepare to become one later?

There’s no clear test or archetype for a founder — successful founders come in all forms, but **resilience** is the single most important trait.


## 🧠 Who Should Start a Startup?

### Common Myths
- Media glorifies two archetypes:  
  - The *ruthless genius coder* (e.g. Zuckerberg)  
  - The *charismatic visionary* (e.g. Jobs)  
- Reality: there are many successful founders with very different profiles.  
  **Don’t disqualify yourself because you don’t fit the stereotype** 

### What Actually Matters
- **Resilience > Confidence.**  
  - Confidence can be faked; resilience can’t.  
  - The best founders endure rejection and keep iterating.  
- **Example: Benchling (YC S12).**  
  - Early doubts: founders seemed too quiet, bad at sales.  
  - Took 2 years to make first revenue.  
  - Now worth $6B+.  
  - Core insight: resilience outlasted every obstacle.



## 💡 Motivation: Why Start a Company?

- **Your initial motivation doesn’t matter much.** It evolves.
- **Money is a fine motivation.** It’s honest and can get you started.  
- **Curiosity is enough.** The experience itself teaches if you’re built for it.
- Over time, lasting motivation comes from:  
  - Genuine interest in the problem  
  - Love for the people you’re working with



## ⚖️ Ask Yourself: “What Do I Have to Lose?”

### Worst-Case Scenario Analysis
- Most startups take **at least a year** before you know if they’re promising.
- You may earn little to no salary during that time.
- If you can’t handle that worst case, your **anxiety will sabotage you.**
- The calculus differs by life stage:
  - **Students:** low downside — job offers can wait.
  - **Senior employees:** higher risk — weigh carefully.

### Don’t Forget the Upside
- You’ll **learn more in a year of startup life** than anywhere else:
  - Sales, product, customer support — all at once.  
  - It clarifies what kind of work you love.  
- Even failure **accelerates your career trajectory.**



## 🧩 The Career Upside of Starting (or Failing)

- Employers value ex-founders for initiative, leadership, and ownership.
- Many successful YC companies *hire ex-founders* (e.g. Rippling hires ~50).
- Career paths often look non-linear:
  - **Nick Grandy:** failed first startup → joined Airbnb → founded OutSchool ($3B)



## 🧱 Part 2 — Preparing to Found Later

### You’ll Need:
1. **An idea**
2. **A co-founder**

They often emerge together — **through conversations.**



## 🧠 How to Find Ideas & Co-founders

- Don’t treat them as separate searches.  
- Talk to people you *love brainstorming with* — people who make you sharper.
- Discuss:
  - Products you admire or find broken.
  - Technologies that feel underrated.
- Debate, iterate, and research between conversations.  
  This primes your brain for startup ideas.



## 🌍 Choose the Right Environment

- **Best place to meet co-founders:** work at a startup.  
  - You’ll see startup life firsthand.  
  - Your colleagues will be more risk-tolerant.  
- If you’re in a FAANG job — consider joining a startup as an intermediate step.



## ⚙️ Turn Ideas into Side Projects

- When you say “It’d be cool if someone built X” — **be that someone.**
- Build small prototypes. Launch something.
- You’re not trying to build a unicorn — you’re learning **to ship.**
- Non-technical? Learn to code enough to build v1.  
  You only need MVP-level skills to start.



## 🚀 When to Take the Leap

- You won’t get a magical “perfect traction” moment.
- Judge by:
  - Are a few users **obsessed** with your product? (Paul Buchheit rule)
  - Do you **love the process** of building and learning?  
  - Does your energy rise after side projects and drop after your day job?  
    → That’s your signal.  
- Finding a co-founder you love working with is rare — if you do, **jump.**



## 🧾 Key Takeaways

1. Don’t overthink your motivation — curiosity is enough.  
2. Be honest about what you can lose — handle the worst case.  
3. Startup experience = learning accelerator, even if you fail.  
4. Surround yourself with people who spark ideas.  
5. Build side projects to practice resilience and shipping.  
6. When you find the right co-founder → **make the leap.**
