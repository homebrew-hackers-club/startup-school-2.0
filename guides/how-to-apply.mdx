## 🧭 Overview

Dalton Caldwell breaks down how to apply — and actually get into — Y Combinator.  
This talk isn’t about checking boxes; it’s about how to **think like a YC founder**.  
Dalton shares how to create your own luck, avoid common self-defeating excuses, and prepare to shine in the interview process.


## 💡 Why It’s Worth Applying

- Applying is **low cost, high upside** — even if you get rejected.  
- The act of applying forces clarity: you define your problem, market, and progress.  
- Many accepted founders say their **first few rejections** helped them refine their vision.  
- You can (and should) apply multiple times; YC doesn’t penalize persistence.


## 🍀 Creating Luck

- Luck favors **those who show up**.  
- YC doesn’t “find” founders — founders make themselves findable.  
- Every application increases your surface area for luck.  
- Don’t wait for perfect timing; **momentum compounds** through small actions.


## 🚫 Weird Reasons People Don’t Apply

- “We’re too early.” — No, early is good. YC backs ideas that are barely alive.  
- “We’re not ready.” — You’ll never feel ready. Progress happens *after* you start.  
- “We’re not from the right place.” — Great founders come from anywhere.  
- “We’ll apply next batch.” — That mindset kills momentum; act now.


## 🧠 Being a YC Founder vs. Watching YC Videos

- Consuming content ≠ doing the work.  
- Real founders move from theory → execution → iteration.  
- The *YouTube version* of YC looks easy; the real thing is emotionally brutal and exhilarating.  
- The difference is **ownership** — being the one who actually builds and ships.


## 💪 How to Stop Being Discouraged

- Every founder feels imposter syndrome — even after getting in.  
- Rejection isn’t failure; it’s feedback.  
- YC has funded teams that applied **5+ times**.  
- Founders who persist improve their odds exponentially with each iteration.


## ⚙️ YC Application Tips

- Be **clear, concise, and direct.** Reviewers read thousands of applications.  
- Avoid jargon — write like you’d explain to a smart friend.  
- Show **traction, not hype.** Screenshots or metrics > buzzwords.  
- The best applications feel like *a conversation with a builder*, not a pitch deck.  
- Record your video early — most rejections happen because founders over-rehearse or delay it.


## 🔍 How YC Reviews Applications

- Every application is reviewed by multiple partners.  
- Reviewers look for:
  - Founders who **build fast and talk simply**.  
  - Teams with **technical ability and ownership**.  
  - Evidence of users, prototypes, or experiments.  
- YC doesn’t care about credentials — only progress and clarity.


## 🎲 Odds of Getting In

- Roughly **1 in 100** applicants get an interview.  
- But each round teaches you something and increases your odds next time.  
- Interviews are short (10 minutes) and designed to stress-test clarity.  
- You can’t memorize your way in — only **understanding your startup deeply** works.


## 🎤 Preparing for the Interview

- YC partners will **interrupt you constantly** — it’s a signal test for clarity.  
- You must answer fast, honestly, and without fluff.  
- Don’t give “pitch” answers — give *truthful* answers.  
- Practice explaining:
  1. What you’re building  
  2. Who it’s for  
  3. Why it matters now  
  4. Why you’re the right person to build it  
- Show that you’ve **talked to users** and can **ship fast**.


## 🧩 What Makes a Great Interview

- High signal: founders who show energy, understanding, and ownership.  
- Low signal: founders who dodge questions, blame teammates, or use jargon.  
- YC looks for people who **listen, think, and adjust in real time**.  
- Passion matters — but **clarity wins**.


## 💬 After the Interview

- If rejected, **ask for feedback** and apply again next batch.  
- YC values persistence more than polish.  
- Your odds improve dramatically the second or third time.  


## 🧾 Key Takeaways

1. Applying to YC costs nothing and forces clarity.  
2. Don’t wait to feel “ready” — iteration is how you become ready.  
3. Create your own luck by shipping, applying, and repeating.  
4. Keep answers short, sharp, and honest.  
5. If you get rejected, apply again. Most successful founders did.
